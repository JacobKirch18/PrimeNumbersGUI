# PrimeNumbersGUI
Windows Forms app that finds prime numbers within a given range.  This is starter code that should be modified to use asynchronous programming to find the prime numbers, otherwise the UI thread is locked-up during the computations.

The executable PrimeNumbers-GUI-McCown.exe is my working solution.
